          After 10 years, I traded in concerts and the maestro for code when I
          left my life as an opera singer and learned Javascript, jQuery, HTML
          and CSS. Now, I work as a Frontend Engineer. No, I will not sing for
          you, but I will fix that website you broke and probably make it a lot
          faster.
